# OpenXinput
This library can help you manage more than 4 xinput gamepads on Windows.

## Why ?
Because the legit Xinput library can only handle 4 XUSB devices while the underlying driver can handle more, with this library, you can use more than 4 controllers if you want to.

## How to use ?
See the [wiki](https://github.com/Nemirtingas/OpenXinput/wiki).
